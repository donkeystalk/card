django cart implementation

Required libraries:

django-flash
https://github.com/danielfm/django-flash

Install to local python distro (normal python setup.py install should work fine)

Running Locally

Make sure to change the following settings in settings.py:

STATICFILES_DIRS

this should point to card/static, but since these locations must be absolute, make this an absolute path.

TEMPLATE_DIRS

this should point to card/templates, again this needs to be an absolute path, so change it to one that applies to your local install.
