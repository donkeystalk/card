django cart implementation

running locally:

make sure to change the following settings in settings.py:

STATICFILES_DIRS

this should point to card/static, but since these locations must be absolute, make this an absolute path.

TEMPLATE_DIRS

this should point to card/templates, again this needs to be an absolute path, so change it to one that applies to your local install.
